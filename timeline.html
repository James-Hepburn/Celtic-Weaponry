        <h3>Urnfield Culture (1300 to 750 BC)</h3>
        <p>The Urnfield culture was a late Bronze Age culture named after the custom of cremating the dead, placing their ashes inside urns, and burying them in fields. A notable feature of this culture was the advanced bronze technology used to create weaponry. Warriors of this time equipped body armour, helmets and shields, all made from bronze.</p>

        <h3>Hallstatt Culture (1200 to 450 BC)</h3>
        <p>The Hallstatt culture began in the late Bronze Age (Hallstatt A) and ended in the early Iron Age (Hallstatt D). It focused on farming and metalworking, especially with iron. Members of the elite were buried with their iron swords, armour, and chariots, showcasing the replacement of bronze with iron tools.</p>
