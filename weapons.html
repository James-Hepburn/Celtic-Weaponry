    <h1>Weapons Overview</h1>
    <p>
      The various weapons the Celts equipped, such as swords, spears, and shields, were essential to their warfare. They protected them in battle while simultaneously representing their culture and community.

        <h2 class="weapon-title">Celtic Swords</h2>
        <p class="weapon-description">
          Celtic warriors gained recognition in battle for the use of their swords. They often served as mercenaries throughout antiquity, fighting alongside the Ancient Greeks and Romans. A warrior’s sword symbolized himself, his status, and his community, so he decorated it with personalized stamps and a sheath of iron, bronze, wood or leather. During the early Hallstatt period, artisans made swords from bronze and iron. However, elite troops typically used iron weapons. Their long swords made them suitable for slashing and had a pointed tip for stabbing. The quality of swords sometimes varied, though, with warriors needing to use their feet to reshape them when they bent during battle.

        <h2 class="weapon-title">Celtic Shields</h2>
        <p class="weapon-description">
          Celtic shields were the primary means of defence used in battle by the Celts. Some warriors even preferred shield protection versus a full suit of armour. The shields were typically oval-shaped but could be rectangular, circular or hexagonal. The front of the shield had an umbos, a metal cup designed to protect the hand of the warrior holding it. They were also made of wood, usually about 1.1m high, 1.2cm thick and weighed about 6kg. They were also covered with leather or felt to prevent splintering during combat. Celtic warriors often decorated their shields and used them in ceremonial practices by throwing them into the river as an offering to the gods.

      <div class="weapon-text">
        <h2 class="weapon-title">Celtic Spears</h2>
        <p class="weapon-description">
          A spear was the most fundamental part of a Celtic warrior’s equipment, primarily because of its affordability. They had two main functions: throwing and thrusting. In terms of appearance, Celtic spears were typically 2.5m long, with 0.5m for the spearhead. The ancient world used four terms to describe the spears: lancea, mataris, saunion and gaesum, each referring to a specific design or use. Artisans typically made them of wood and a blade for the spearhead that had various designs used for easy penetration. Spear butts were also standard and used to protect the lower end of the weapon,  as backup damage when attacking and as a counterbalance when throwing.

      <div class="weapon-text">
        <h2 class="weapon-title">Celtic Slings</h2>
        <p class="weapon-description">
          The typical Celtic battle arraignment did not contain slings, so in ancient sources, they were primarily mentioned in passing. Slings were made of leather and have not survived to the modern day. Their primary purpose was to protect against a surprise attack by invaders. Warriors used slings in combination with clay rocks or beach pebbles of approximately 50 grams.

      <div class="weapon-text">
        <h2 class="weapon-title">Celtic Bow and Arrows</h2>
        <p class="weapon-description">
          Hunters in the ancient world predominantly used the bow and arrow for hunting. However, Celtic warriors sometimes made up the army as archers. The archer class was usually the lower class of society, but they played a significant role in battle regardless.

      <div class="weapon-text">
        <h2 class="weapon-title">Celtic Helmets</h2>
        <p class="weapon-description">
          Celtic warriors rarely used helmets, which began to appear in graves after the fifth century BC. Helmets, made of bronze and decorated with animal motifs, were primarily found in Italy. Celts more often used helmets ceremoniously. They were often used in processions as symbols of high status, crafting them with expensive materials like gold and coral.

        <h2 class="weapon-title">Celtic Armour</h2>
        <p class="weapon-description">
          In the early period, some Celtic warriors went into battle naked. Later on, around 500 BC, they wore padded armour similar to the Etruscans and Greeks. Then, as Celtic metalworking advanced in the fourth century BC, chainmail armour emerged. There were two methods to making chainmail: rings with loops butted together and rings riveted together. Due to its cumbersomeness, Chainmail weighed 32 pounds and had broad shoulder straps to counteract its weight. Bronze breastplates were sometimes used in La Tene culture as well.
