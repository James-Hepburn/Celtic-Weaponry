        <h2 class="artifact-title">The Gundestrup Cauldron</h2>
        <p class="artifact-description">
          The Gundestrup cauldron was a silver vessel dating between 150 BC and 1 BC. Archaeologists found it dismantled in a Denmark bog in 1891. Due to its quality, metallurgy, and imagery, researchers believe it to have Gaulish and Thracian origins. The central panel of the cauldron depicts Cernunnos, the god associated with natural and animal elements. Other panels depict scenes with warriors marching in a procession. These warriors wield spears, shields, armour and cavalry, which provides modern scholars with an insight into how the Celts fought.

        <p class="artifact-description">
          The Battersea shield was a bronze sheet covering a wooden shield. Researchers discovered it in the River Thames in London in 1857 and believe it dates between 350 BC and 50 BC. The shield features repousse decoration, engraving, and 27 small circular enamels. Archaeologists have concluded that due to the bronze’s thinness and the shield’s lack of battle damage, it was purely for votive offerings or ceremonial purposes.

        <p class="artifact-description">
          The Agris helmet was a ceremonial helmet from 350 BC. Archaeologists found it in a cave in France in 1981. Its purpose was as a valuable ceremonial headpiece rather than in combat. The helmet consisted of an iron cap covered in bronze, which was then covered with pure gold leaves, coral decorations, and silver attachments. One cheek guard, made of similar material and style, was found attached.
